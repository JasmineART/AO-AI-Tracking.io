# 🔥 URGENT: Fix Firestore Database Errors

## Problem Identified

Your Firebase project `oa-ai-dash` **does not have a Firestore database created yet**.

All the errors you're seeing:
- `Failed to get document because the client is offline`
- `400 Bad Request` on Firestore API calls
- `WebChannelConnection RPC 'Listen' stream transport errored`

These all mean: **Firestore database is missing!**

---

## Solution: Create Firestore Database (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Firestore Console

**Direct Link:**
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/oa-ai-dash/firestore
```

### Step 2: Click "Create Database"

You'll see a button that says **"Create database"** or **"Get started"**.

### Step 3: Choose Security Rules

When prompted, select:
- **Start in production mode** (recommended)

OR

- **Start in test mode** (easier for development, but less secure)

### Step 4: Choose Location

Select a region close to you:
- `us-central1` (Iowa) - recommended for US
- `us-east1` (South Carolina)
- `europe-west1` (Belgium) - for Europe
- `asia-northeast1` (Tokyo) - for Asia

**Important:** You CANNOT change this later!

### Step 5: Click "Enable"

Wait 30-60 seconds for the database to be created.

### Step 6: Set Up Security Rules

Go to the **Rules** tab and paste this:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /projects/{projectId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

Click **"Publish"**

## After Creating the Database

### Test Your Site Again

1. **Refresh your deployed site:**
   ```
   https://JasmineART.github.io/AO-AI-Tracking.io/
   ```

2. **Open browser console** (F12)

3. **Try to sign in with Google or Demo login**

4. **Check console** - the Firestore errors should be gone!
